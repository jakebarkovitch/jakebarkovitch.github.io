Hello! I'm a motivated Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher with 3+ years experience in multiple research streams and industry roles. From developing a novel dataset of 50,000+ high-stake lying facial images, to leveraging databases of over 600,000+ samples, I have striven to broaden my research skills whenever I can.

Having grown up on a sustainable agriculture farm, I have always been passionate about environmentalism. I believe that the work we do in the field of computer science has the potential to lead to a healthier planet. Through my research, I ultimately want to leave a positive impact. The high-stake lying dataset I helped create could help the wrongfully convicted. The research I do in materials science, on discovering new metal-organic frameworks, could be used in gas separation, air purification, and carbon capture.

My experience as a researcher allowed me to obtain a position as an Artificial Intelligence Research Associate at a startup company directly involved in lowering harmful emissions from power plants. This rewarding position lets me leave a positive impact on the planet. Through analyzing furnace sensors and camera image data, we can optimize the combustion of fuel in real-time for improved efficiency and functionality.

My goal is to continue to improve society and the planet in one way or another, and my hope is that the company I eventually work for shares this goal.
