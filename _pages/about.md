Hello! My name is Jacob Barkovitch and I am a motivated Data Science and Machine Learning Researcher with 5+ years experience in multiple research streams and 2+ in industry roles. From developing a novel dataset of 50,000+ high-stake lying facial images, to leveraging databases of over 20 million samples, I have striven to broaden my research skills whenever I can.

Having grown up on a sustainable agricultural farm, I have always been passionate about environmentalism. I believe that the work we do in the field of computer science has the potential to lead to a healthier planet. Through my research, I ultimately want to leave a positive impact. The high-stake lying dataset I helped create and publish could help the wrongfully convicted. The research I do in materials science, on discovering new metal-organic frameworks, could be used in gas separation, air purification, and carbon capture.

My experience as a researcher allowed me to serve in an internship as an Artificial Intelligence Research Associate at a startup company directly involved in lowering harmful emissions from power plants. This rewarding position lets me leave a positive impact on the planet. Through analyzing furnace sensors and camera image data, we can optimize the combustion of fuel in real-time for improved efficiency and functionality.

My goal is to continue to improve society and the planet in one way or another, and follow this trend throughout my career. I currently work as a Consultant on the Strategic Sourcing Optimization team for The Resource Group, subsidiary of Ascension Healthcare. In this role I build out analytical tools, dashboards and reports for business leaders and departments to help guide their decision making. The work I do helps save costs for both the company and the patients seeking affordable care.
