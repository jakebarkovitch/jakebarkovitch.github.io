  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract="Unstaged data with people acting naturally in real-world scenarios is essential for high-stakes deception detection (HSDD) research. Unfortunately, multiple HSDD studies involve staged scenarios in controlled settings with subjects who were instructed to lie. Using in-the-wild footage of subjects and analyzing facial expressions instead of invasive tracking of biological processes enables the collection of real-world data. Poker is a high-stakes game involving a deceptive strategy called bluffing and is an ideal research subject for improving HSDD techniques. Videos of professional poker tournaments online provide a convenient data source. Because proficiency in HSDD generalizes well for different high-stakes situations, findings from poker bluff detection research have the potential to transfer well to other more practical HSDD applications like interrogations and customs inspections. In the hopes of encouraging additional research on real-world HSDD, we present a novel in-the-wild dataset for poker bluff detection. To verify the quality of our dataset, we test its regression accuracy and achieve a Mean Square Error of 0.0288 with an InceptionV3 model.",
