Below is the static version of the webapp that me and and another student created for a hackathon at our college. The deployed version has a machine learning model backend trained on over 1 million samples of US Census Bureau data in order to take in a person's characteristics and predict their salary. People can then use this tool to detect if they are being paid less than those who are equally qualified (without regard to charactistics like race or gender). those fields are optional so that the tool can also be used to compare wages across different groups of people such as men versus women or minorities.
